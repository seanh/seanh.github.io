How I Use Restic to Back up My Home Folders to Backblaze B2
===========================================================

<p class="lead" markdown="1">
My guide to using the open source backup program
[restic](https://restic.net/)
to back up your home folders to 
[Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html)
cloud storage.

</div>

### Operating system
{:.no_toc}

This will probably work more or less the same on other operating systems
(restic works on Linux, BSD, macOS and Windows)
but I've only tried it on Ubuntu.
The main differences will probably be the commands for installing packages like
restic and pass.

### Manual backups
{:.no_toc}

Best practice would say that regular backups should happen automatically.  I
don't automate my backups, this post assumes that you're going to run a
`~/.restic/backup` script manually each time you want to update your backup.
The script isn't suitable for being run non-interactively (e.g. by cron)
because it runs `pass` subcommands that pop up a dialog asking for a password
to unlock a GPG key.

I have a keyboard shortcut for the end of the day that runs a backup and then
suspends the computer. In case I forget about this I have a repeating reminder
(in the Reminders app on my iPhone) to remind me to update my backup every
week. Another less frequently repeating reminder reminds me to run my
`~/.restic/maint` script to verify my backup.

Backing up a new machine for the first time
-----------------------------------------------

### 1. Create a B2 bucket

All files in B2 are contained in
[buckets](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/buckets.html), which are like the
top-level folders in your B2 account. Before you can back anything up to B2 you
need to create a bucket:
[Sign in to the Backblaze website](https://secure.backblaze.com/user_signin.htm),
navigate to the [B2 Cloud Storage Buckets page](https://secure.backblaze.com/b2_buckets.htm),
and click the <kbd>Create a Bucket</kbd> button:

<figure markdown="1">
  ![Creating a B2 bucket.]({{ "/assets/images/restic/create-bucket.png" | relative_url }} "Creating a B2 bucket.")
  <figcaption markdown="1">
  Creating a B2 bucket.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Bucket names must be unique across all of B2, including the names of other user's buckets!
Hence the random numbers at the end of the bucket name.

Make sure the bucket is set to **Private**.

You can leave B2's default encryption disabled: restic will encrypt your files for you.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>One-to-one mapping between buckets and repositories</b></summary>
You'll see below that
I create one restic repository in each B2 bucket, at the root of the bucket.
That's why the `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` environment variable that I use below contains just a
bucket name with no path (`b2:restic-seanh-laptop-79539`).

Alternatively you could create the restic repository in a subdirectory within the bucket.
Just add a path to the end of your `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` like this: `b2:bucketname:path/to/repo`.
This would allow a single B2 bucket to contain multiple restic repositories at
different paths, and I *think* B2 application keys can be given access restricted
to subpaths of buckets so different hosts don't have access to each other's backups.

I find it simpler to create a separate bucket for each restic repo.
A B2 account is limited to 100 buckets so if you have a lot of restic repos you
might want to try sharing buckets.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Shared versus separate repos</b></summary>
When backing up multiple computers they can all back up to the same restic repo
or each computer can back up to its own restic repo.

Most of the time I create a separate B2 bucket and restic repo for each machine
because it's more secure: machines don't have access to each other's backups.

But my work desktop and work laptop both share the same repo.  This is more
storage efficient because restic will deduplicate files across the two
different hosts (if the desktop and laptop both contain copies of the same file
only one copy of that data will actually be stored in the restic repository).
These machines have a lot of files in common so the deduplication might be
significant. And there's already all sorts of shared sensitive files that I
have on both of these machines (my GPG and SSH keys, log ins to my Bitwarden
account, etc) and both machines use full disk encryption so I think the
security risk is acceptable.

I create a separate B2 application key for each machine, even when machines
share the same repo, so that each machine's access can be revoked individually
if that machine is compromised.

When multiple machines share the same restic repo I also give each machine its own
separate `RESTIC_PASSWORD`. These are managed using the
[`restic key` command](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/070_encryption.html)
(for example to add a new password to an existing repo, or to remove a password).
See `restic help key` for docs.
</details>

### 2. Create an application key for the B2 bucket

Restic needs a B2
[application key](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/application_keys.html)
to read and write to the bucket.
Navigate to the [Application Keys page](https://secure.backblaze.com/app_keys.htm)
and click the <kbd>Add a New Application Key</kbd> button:

<figure markdown="1">
  ![Creating an application key.]({{ "/assets/images/restic/create-key.png" | relative_url }} "Creating an application key.")
  <figcaption markdown="1">
  Creating an application key.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In the <samp>Allow access to Bucket(s)</samp> dropdown select only the bucket you just created.

<samp>Type of Access</samp> must be set to <samp>Read and Write</samp>.

Copy the `keyID` that's shown after you click <kbd>Create New Key</kbd>, you'll need it later:

<figure markdown="1">
  ![Copying the application key.]({{ "/assets/images/restic/key.png" | relative_url }} "Copying the application key.")
  <figcaption markdown="1">
  Copy the application key for later.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### 3. Install pass

We're going to use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) to save encrypted
copies of the application key and other restic settings on the host machine
that's going to be backed up. On the host machine:

1. Install pass:

   ```terminal
   $ sudo apt install pass
   ```

2. Create a GPG keypair for pass to encrypt things with:

   ```terminal
   $ gpg --full-generate-key
   ...
   public and secret key created and signed.

   pub   rsa3072 2022-04-03 [SC]
         6346C69761B1155E228D488F8C23BC2681C72FBA
   uid                      Sean Hammond (GPG key for `pass` on seanh-laptop)
   sub   rsa3072 2022-04-03 [E]
   ```

   Take note of the key's UID (the part beginning `6346...`), you'll need it for the next step.
   (You can always retrieve it with `gpg --list-secret-keys`).

3. Initialize the password store with the GPG key:

   ```terminal
   $ pass init <GPG_KEY_ID>
   ```

### 4. Insert restic settings into pass

Insert the B2 bucket name, application key ID, and application key value into pass:

```terminal
$ pass insert RESTIC_REPOSITORY
<When prompted enter "b2:" followed by the name of the B2 bucket you created.>
<Example: b2:restic-seanh-laptop-79539>

$ pass insert B2_ACCOUNT_ID
<When prompted paste in the keyID of the application key that you created.>

$ pass insert B2_ACCOUNT_KEY
<When prompted paste in the secret value the application key that you created.>
```

### 5. Generate a `RESTIC_PASSWORD` and save it in Bitwarden and pass

restic also needs a `RESTIC_PASSWORD` setting which is the password it'll use
to encrypt your backups.

`RESTIC_PASSWORD` is a restic thing, B2 doesn't know anything about it.
While `RESTIC_REPOSITORY`, `B2_ACCOUNT_ID` and `B2_ACCOUNT_KEY` can all be
retrieved or regenerated from the Backblaze website, `RESTIC_PASSWORD` can't
be. And since `RESTIC_PASSWORD` is what's used to encrypt your backups, if you
lose your `RESTIC_PASSWORD` you've lost your backups. So I save a copy of each
`RESTIC_PASSWORD` in my cloud password manager ([Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/))
as well as in pass on the host machine. Conveniently Bitwarden can also be used
to generate a secure password:

1. Use Bitwarden to generate a password and save it as a secure note.

2. Insert the password into pass:

   ```terminal
   $ pass insert RESTIC_PASSWORD
   <When prompted paste in the password>
```

### 6. Create an env script

Create a `~/.restic` folder (`mkdir ~/.restic`) and create a
`~/.restic/env.bash` script to load the restic settings from pass into
environment variables:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

RESTIC_REPOSITORY=$(pass RESTIC_REPOSITORY)
B2_ACCOUNT_ID=$(pass B2_ACCOUNT_ID)
B2_ACCOUNT_KEY=$(pass B2_ACCOUNT_KEY)
RESTIC_PASSWORD=$(pass RESTIC_PASSWORD)

export RESTIC_REPOSITORY B2_ACCOUNT_ID B2_ACCOUNT_KEY RESTIC_PASSWORD
```

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>fish-shell</b></summary>
If you use fish-shell you might also want to create a `~/.restic/env.fish`
script that you can `source` from fish:

```fish
#!/usr/bin/fish

set -x RESTIC_REPOSITORY (pass RESTIC_REPOSITORY)
set -x B2_ACCOUNT_ID (pass B2_ACCOUNT_ID)
set -x B2_ACCOUNT_KEY (pass B2_ACCOUNT_KEY)
set -x RESTIC_PASSWORD (pass RESTIC_PASSWORD)
```
</details>

### 7. Source the env script

Now you can `source` the `env.bash` script from a bash shell and any subsequent
restic commands in that shell session will use your B2 bucket, application key,
and restic password without having to pass them as options to each command.

**The rest of the commands in this post will assume you've sourced the `env.bash` script**,
so do that now:

```terminal
$ source ~/.restic/env.bash
```

The script can also be sourced from other bash scripts, which we'll do below.

### 8. Install restic

Install restic and update it to the latest version:

```terminal
$ sudo apt install restic
$ sudo restic self-update
```

### 9. Initialize a restic repo in the B2 bucket

Initialize a restic repository (repo) in the B2 bucket:

```terminal
$ restic init
created restic repository 191d720a00 at b2:restic-seanh-laptop-79539

Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access
the repository. Losing your password means that your data is
irrecoverably lost.
```

If you browse your bucket in Backblaze you should see that restic has created
some housekeeping files in it:

![Files created by `restic init`.]({{ "/assets/images/restic/files.png" | relative_url }} "Files created by `restic init`.")

### 10. Create a backup script

Create a `~/.restic/backup` script that runs a `restic backup` command to back
up your home directory.

You'll want to pass some command line options to `restic backup`, consider:

`--exclude-caches`
: Excludes directories that are marked as caches by having a `CACHEDIR.TAG` file.

`--one-file-system`
: Excludes any other file systems that're mounted within your home directory.

`--cleanup-cache`
: Removes old cache directories after running.

`--exclude <FILE>`
: Excludes unwanted files from the backup.
  `--exclude` can be given multiple times, and `<FILE>` can be a pattern.
  There are other options for excluding or including files as well,
  see [Excluding Files](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/040_backup.html#excluding-files)
  in the restic docs for details.
  You might want to use Disk Usage Analyzer (`baobab`) to scan your home directory for large files
  or folders that you don't want to back up.

Here's an example `~/.restic/backup` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

source ~/.restic/env.bash

restic backup \
    --exclude-caches \
    --one-file-system \
    --cleanup-cache \
    --exclude "$HOME/.local/share/Trash" \
    --exclude "$HOME/Downloads" \
    "$HOME"
```

### 11. Make the backup script executable

```terminal
$ chmod u+x ~/.restic/backup
```

### 12. Do the initial backup

Finally, to backup your home directory to B2 just run:

```terminal
$ ~/.restic/backup
```

This will take a long time to run. Once it's finished you'll see more files in
your B2 bucket:

![Files created by `restic backup`.]({{ "/assets/images/restic/finished-files.png" | relative_url }} "Files created by `restic backup`.")

Updating a backup
-----------------

To incrementally update a machine's backup, uploading only new or modified files,
just re-run the same backup script:

```terminal
$ ~/.restic/backup
```

Interrupting and resuming a backup
----------------------------------

You can interrupt a backup with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> and later resume
it by re-running the same `~/.restic/backup` command.
See [Will restic resume an interrupted backup?](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#will-restic-resume-an-interrupted-backup)
in restic's FAQ.

Backing up just one file to the same repo
-----------------------------------------

You can run a one-off command to quickly back up one or more specific files or
directories to the same repo, without doing an incremental backup of the
whole machine. Just pass the file path(s) to `restic backup`:

```terminal
$ restic backup --verbose=3 foo.txt
open repository
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
lock repository
load index files
no parent snapshot found, will read all files
start scan on [foo.txt]
start backup on [foo.txt]
scan finished in 28.574s: 1 files, 4 B
new       /foo.txt, saved in 0.004s (4 B added)

Files:           1 new,     0 changed,     0 unmodified
Dirs:            0 new,     0 changed,     0 unmodified
Data Blobs:      1 new
Tree Blobs:      1 new
Added to the repo: 384 B

processed 1 files, 4 B in 0:35
snapshot c6d56f86 saved
```

Doing a dry run with `restic backup --dry-run`
----------------------------------------------

You can always test what a `restic backup` command would do by passing the
`--dry-run` and `--verbose` arguments.
This can be good for testing whether your exclude options will do what you expect,
or checking how much data will be added to the backup before actually running it:

```terminal
$ restic backup --dry-run --verbose=3 foo.txt
open repository
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
lock repository
load index files
no parent snapshot found, will read all files
start scan on [foo.txt]
start backup on [foo.txt]
scan finished in 8.994s: 1 files, 4 B
new       /foo.txt, saved in 0.003s (0 B added)

Files:           1 new,     0 changed,     0 unmodified
Dirs:            0 new,     0 changed,     0 unmodified
Data Blobs:      0 new
Tree Blobs:      1 new
Would add to the repo: 380 B

processed 1 files, 4 B in 0:09
```

Comparing two snapshots with `restic diff`
------------------------------------------

You can use `restic diff` to compare the contents of two snapshots.
Comparing a snapshot to the previous snapshot can be like a
retrospective `--dry-run`, showing you what a `restic backup` did.

First use [`restic snapshots`](#listing-snapshots-with-restic-snapshots) to get
the IDs of two snapshots that you want to compare, then pass them to `restic
diff`:

```terminal
$ restic diff 9eb356c4 b072e1ac
-    foo.txt
+    bar.txt
M    gar.txt

Files:           1 new, 1 removed,     1 changed
Dirs:            0 new, 0 removed
Others:          0 new,    0 removed
Data Blobs:      1 new, 1 removed
Tree Blobs:      1 new, 1 removed
  Added:   384 B
  Removed: 51.780 GiB
```

In the list of files `+` denotes a file that was added,
`-` is a file that was removed,
`M` means the file's contents were modified,
`U` means the file's metadata was changed
and `T` mean's the file's type was changed (for example it changed from a file
to a symlink).

Restoring files from your backup
--------------------------------

### Listing snapshots with `restic snapshots`

`restic snapshots` prints out a list of all the snapshots in the repo (each
completed `restic backup` command creates a new snapshot):

```terminal
$ restic snapshots
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
ID        Time                 Host          Tags        Paths

16 snapshots
```

This is mostly useful for getting snapshot IDs to pass to commands like
`restic restore` and `restic diff` (see below).

### Listing files in snapshots with `restic ls`

`restic ls` lists files within snapshots.
This is mostly useful for finding files to restore with `restic restore` (see
below).

```terminal
$ # List all files in the latest snapshot from any host.
$ restic ls latest
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
snapshot 7518e078 of [/home/seanh/foo.txt] filtered by [] at 2022-04-02 22:23:21.053983381 +0100 BST):
/foo.txt

$ # List all files in the latest snapshot from the current host.
$ restic ls --host "$(hostname)" latest
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
snapshot 7518e078 of [/home/seanh/foo.txt] filtered by [] at 2022-04-02 22:23:21.053983381 +0100 BST):
/foo.txt

$ # List all files in the latest snapshot of your home directory from the
$ # current host.
$ restic ls --host "$(hostname)" --path "$HOME" latest
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
snapshot 7518e078 of [/home/seanh/foo.txt] filtered by [] at 2022-04-02 22:23:21.053983381 +0100 BST):
/foo.txt

$ # List all files in a specific snapshot by snapshot ID.
$ restic ls 7518e078
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
snapshot 7518e078 of [/home/seanh/foo.txt] filtered by [] at 2022-04-02 22:23:21.053983381 +0100 BST):
/foo.txt

$ # List all files in the $HOME/Mail directory in the latest snapshot.
$ # When one or more directory arguments are given it only lists top-level files
$ # and folders in the given folder(s) unless you also give --recursive to tell
$ # it to recurse into subfolders.
$ restic ls --recursive latest $HOME/Mail
...
```

### Restoring files from a snapshot with `restic restore`

Use [`restic snapshots`](#listing-snapshots-with-restic-snapshots) to find the ID of the snapshot that you want to restore from.
(`f11c451b` in the examples below).
Then to restore the entire contents of the snapshot to a `/tmp/restored` directory:

```terminal
$ mkdir /tmp/restored
$ restic restore f11c451b --target /tmp/restored
```

Add `--verify` to verify the contents of the files after restoring them.

Use `--include` to restore just a single file or folder from the snapshot:

```terminal
$ restic restore f11c451b --target /tmp/restore-work --include /foo.txt
```

`--include` can be given multiple times to restore multiple specific files or
folders at once and patterns can be used to restore all files that match a
pattern.
There's also `--exclude` to exclude specific or matching files from the
restore, restoring everything that _isn't_ excluded.
See [Restoring from backup](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/050_restore.html)
in the restic docs or `restic help restore` for details.

#### Restoring from the "latest" snapshot

You can use `latest` instead of a snapshot ID to restore from the most recent snapshot:

```terminal
$ restic restore latest --target /tmp/restored
```

`latest` on its own means the most recent snapshot **from any host** and **of any path**.

If you have multiple hosts backing up to the same repo and you want to restore
the latest snapshot from the current host use `--host "$(hostname)"` with
`latest`.

If you back up multiple paths to the same repo and you want to restore the
latest snapshot of your home directory use `--path "$HOME"` with `latest`.

Here's an example combining both:

```terminal
$ restic restore --host "$(hostname)" --path "$HOME" latest --target /tmp/restored
```

Maintaining your backup
-----------------------

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
If your backup is large the `restic prune` and `restic check` commands can
download a lot of data (potentially gigabytes) because they need to load all
your indexes and snapshots. This can take a long time and cost you a lot of
money in B2 download fees. For this reason you might not want to run `prune`
and `check` too frequently. I run the `~/.restic/maint` script below once a
year.
</div>

### Deleting snapshots with `restic forget` and `restic purge`

You can delete old snapshots to save storage space.
To delete a specific snapshot or snapshots get the snapshot ID(s) from
[`restic snapshots`](#listing-snapshots-with-restic-snapshots) and pass them to `restic forget`. For example:

```terminal
$ restic forget f11c451b bea27147 f7e72151
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
[0:02] 100.00%  3 / 3 files deleted...
```

Just forgetting snapshots doesn't actually save any space.
You then have to run `restic prune` to find and delete the data that's no
longer used by any of the remaining snapshots:

```terminal
$ restic prune
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
loading indexes...
loading all snapshots...
finding data that is still in use for 17 snapshots
[2:37] 100.00%  17 / 17 snapshots...
searching used packs...
collecting packs for deletion and repacking
[1:01] 100.00%  181618 / 181618 packs processed...

to repack:             0 blobs / 0 B
this removes:          0 blobs / 0 B
to delete:             5 blobs / 1.986 KiB
total prune:           5 blobs / 1.986 KiB
remaining:       5877282 blobs / 862.804 GiB
unused size after prune: 16.160 GiB (1.87% of remaining size)

rebuilding index
[7:50] 100.00%  181616 / 181616 packs processed...
deleting obsolete index files
[0:17] 100.00%  120 / 120 files deleted...
removing 2 old packs

Restic's docs advise you to run `restic check` (see below) after doing a `restic prune`.

To automatically select which snapshots to delete use `restic forget` with one
or more `--keep-*` options. There are lots of `--keep-*` options, like
`--keep-last n` to keep the last n snapshots or `--keep-hourly n` to keep only
one snapshot per hour for the last `n` hours that have snapshots.
See [Removing snapshots according to a policy](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/060_forget.html#removing-snapshots-according-to-a-policy)
in restic's docs for all the details. Any snapshots that don't match one of the
given `--keep-*` options will be deleted.

<div class="warning" markdown="1">
By default `restic forget` will delete snapshots **from all hosts** and **of any path**.

If you have multiple hosts backing up to the same repo add
`--host "$(hostname)"` to limit restic to only deleting snapshots from the current
host.

If you back up multiple paths to the same repo add `--path "$HOME"`
to limit restic to only deleting snapshots of your home directory.
</div>

Use `--dry-run` to see which snapshots would be deleted without actually
deleting them.

`--tag <TAG>` will limit restic to only deleting snapshots with the given tag(s)
(can be given multiple times or the `<TAG>` can be a comma-separated list).

Use `--tag ''` to limit restic to only deleting _untagged_ snapshots.
This way you can protect certain snapshots from deletion by tagging them.
Either use `restic tag --add foo <SNAPSHOT_ID>` to add a tag to an existing
snapshot or pass `--tag foo` to the `restic backup` command when you first
create the snapshot. For example to add the tag `foo` to the latest snapshot:

```terminal
$ restic tag --add foo latest
```

See `restic help tag` for more documentation on managing tags.
You can use [`restic snapshots`](#listing-snapshots-with-restic-snapshots) to see which snapshots have which tags.

Here's an example using some of the `--keep-*` options:

```terminal
$ restic forget --dry-run \
                --host "$(hostname)" \
                --path "$HOME" \
                --tag '' \
                --keep-within-daily 7d \
                --keep-within-weekly 1m \
                --keep-within-monthly 1y \
                --keep-within-yearly 100y
```

This will keep daily snapshots for the last week,
weekly snapshots for the last month,
monthly snapshots for the last year,
and yearly snapshots for the last century.
"Last week/month/year/century" are relative to the date of the latest snapshot,
not to the current date.
In addition it will keep all snapshots that are not from the current host,
all snapshots that are not of your home directory,
and all tagged snapshots.
All other snapshots will be deleted (if the command is re-run without the
`--dry-run`).

Again, you'd then need to run `restic prune` to actually free up the space.

### Verifying a backup with `restic check`

The `restic check` command verifies the integrity of your restic repository:

```terminal
$ restic check
using temporary cache in /tmp/restic-check-cache-423433534
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
created new cache in /tmp/restic-check-cache-423433534
create exclusive lock for repository
load indexes
check all packs
check snapshots, trees and blobs
[2:02:10] 100.00%  130 / 130 snapshots
no errors were found
```

`restic check` just checks the "structural integrity and consistency" of the
backup. If you want to check that the actual backed up files are correct you
can use `restic check --read-data` but this will download all the files in
the repository which can take a long time and add a lot of money to your
Backblaze bill. Alternatively you can use `restic check --read-data-subset=1G`
to check just a random one gigabyte subset of the data:

```terminal
$ restic check --read-data-subset=1G
using temporary cache in /tmp/restic-check-cache-844156038
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
created new cache in /tmp/restic-check-cache-844156038
create exclusive lock for repository
load indexes
check all packs
check snapshots, trees and blobs
[2:11:01] 100.00%  130 / 130 snapshots
read 1G of data packs
[0:06] 100.00%  1 / 1 packs
no errors were found
```

`restic check` with `--read-data` or `--read-data-subset` first checks the
repo's structural integrity and consistency (everything that a plain
`restic check` would do) and _then_ downloads and checks the files.

There are other ways to specify the subset to check as well,
see [Checking integrity and consistency](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/045_working_with_repos.html#checking-integrity-and-consistency)
in the restic docs.

### Create a maintenance script

To make maintaining your backup easy create a `~/.restic/maint` script that runs
`restic forget` with some `--keep-*` options, then `restic prune`, then `restic check`.
Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

source ~/.restic/env.bash

restic forget \
    --host "$(hostname)" \
    --path "$HOME" \
    --tag '' \
    --keep-within-daily 7d \
    --keep-within-weekly 1m \
    --keep-within-monthly 1y \
    --keep-within-yearly 100y

restic prune

restic check --read-data-subset=1G
```

Make the `~/.restic/maint` script executable:

```terminal
$ chmod u+x ~/.restic/maint
```

Now to weed out old snapshots and verify your backup you can just run:

```terminal
$ ~/.restic/maint
```

restic's built-in help
----------------------

restic has built-in reference documentation for all its subcommands and options.
For a list of restic's subcommands and global flags run `restic help` or
`restic --help`:

```terminal
$ restic help
```

For documentation of a subcommand and its options run `restic help <SUBCOMMAND>`
or `restic <SUBCOMMAND> --help`, for example:

```terminal
$ restic help backup
```

Troubleshooting
---------------

### "Please specify repository location" error

If you get this error:

    Fatal: Please specify repository location (-r or --repository-file)

It probably means you forgot to source your env file. Run:

```terminal
$ source ~/.restic/env.bash
```

And then re-run your original command.

### "unable to create lock in backend" error

If you get this error:

    unable to create lock in backend: repository is already locked exclusively by PID ...
    ...
    lock was created at ...
    storage ID ...
    the `unlock` command can be used to remove stale locks

Just run the `restic unlock` command, as the error message says:

```terminal
$ restic unlock
```

And then re-run your original command.

Stale locks can happen if a restic command crashes or if a computer that was running
a restic command crashes or loses power etc.

TODO
----

### `restic find`

There's a `restic find` command for finding files that match a pattern,
searching across all snapshots at once which could be useful. It's poorly
documented and didn't seem to behave as I expected it to. Just grepping the
output of `restic ls` can probably get you pretty far.

### `restic mount`

There's a `restic mount` command for mounting your snapshots as a browseable FUSE filesystem.
You can restore files by just copying them normally.

```terminal
$ mkdir /tmp/restic
$ restic mount /tmp/restic
repository d59c3d15 opened successfully, password is correct
Now serving the repository at /tmp/restic/
Use another terminal or tool to browse the contents of this folder.
When finished, quit with Ctrl-c here or umount the mountpoint.
```

I found `restic mount` to be buggy when I tried it.
It worked once, but after that the mounted filesystem kept appearing to be empty.

### What if `restic check` finds a problem?

What should you do if `restic check` reports a problem with your backup?
I've never had this happen so I don't know how to handle it.
Will restic offer to fix the problem or suggest a solution?
Should you create a new repo and start again from scratch?
