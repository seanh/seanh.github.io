Title_: I blog, you blog, weblog.

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sean. 
Web developer and future Portuguese Water Dog owner,
currently working for [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/)
and living in <s>Berlin</s>, <s>Edinburgh</s>, <ins>Leith</ins>.

This is my site where I post text on the Internet.
It's mostly notes about computer things.
I find writing these helpful for my learning process and future reference.
Sometimes other people even read them! Think of it as a sort of public
notebook.

You can also find me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/seanh/),
[GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/seanh/public),
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1175266), and
[Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:seanh).
