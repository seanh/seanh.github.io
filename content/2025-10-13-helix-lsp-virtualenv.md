How to get the text editor [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) working with Python
language servers and virtual environments.
Plus a guide to Helix's LSP-based features.
</p>

Helix is a neat little vim-like, modal, terminal text editor (written in Rust!)
with a low-config, good-defaults approach and modern features.

theme I'm using in these screenshots is `modus_operandi_deuteranopia`,
one of Helix's builtin themes. It's a port of the
[modus themes for Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes).
</figcaption>
</figure>

One of Helix's headline features is
[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP)
support for features like autocomplete, diagnostics (i.e. in-editor linting and type checking), go-to-definition,
find-all-references, showing docstrings on hover, code formatting, etc.

LSP servers for many programming languages provide code intelligence features
to LSP clients like Helix. A single LSP server can be used by many different
editors, and a single editor can use many LSP servers. As we'll see Helix can
even use multiple servers for the same language at the same time and combine
the results.

Helix comes out of the box with [pre-configured support for many language servers](https://docs.helix-editor.com/lang-support.html).
But it doesn't quite "just work": you still have to install the language
servers themselves, Python virtual environments are still an obstacle,
and you also need to learn about Helix's LSP-based features and how to use them.

I've been trying out Helix and took notes as I configured and tested its LSP support.
This post will hand-hold you through installing Helix,
installing the Python language servers that Helix supports,
and getting it all working with your virtualenvs.

We'll then do a little tour of Helix's LSP-based features and how to use and configure them.

## Install Helix

It's really easy to install an up-to-date version of Helix,
see [Helix's installation docs](https://docs.helix-editor.com/install.html) for all the different install methods available.
I'm on macOS these days so I installed Helix using Homebrew.
First [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you haven't already,
then use Homebrew to install Helix:

```shell-session
$ brew install helix
```

That's it!
One stumbling block: the command to launch Helix isn't `helix`, it's `hx`.  So
to launch Helix just run:

```shell-session
$ hx
```

<small markdown="1">(If you find you keep forgetting this you might consider adding a `helix` &rarr;
`hx` alias to your  shell config. I can see why they did it though: `hx` is very
short and easy to type.)</small>

## Install uv

Helix's language server support comes pre-configured and enabled out-of-the-box,
but you still need to install the actual _language servers_ yourself.

In this post we're interested in Python language servers
and the best way to install Python tools nowadays is by using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/),
so we'll first need to install uv. Fortunately this is also really easy.
There are [various ways to install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/),
I've already used Homebrew to install Helix so I'll use it again for uv:

```shell-session
$ brew install uv
```

## Install the Python language servers

You can see which language servers Helix supports out-of-the-box for each language on the
[language support page in Helix's docs](https://docs.helix-editor.com/lang-support.html)
or by running `hx --health`:

```shell-session
$ hx --health python
Configured language servers:
  ✘ ty: 'ty' not found in $PATH
  ✘ ruff: 'ruff' not found in $PATH
  ✘ jedi: 'jedi-language-server' not found in $PATH
  ✘ pylsp: 'pylsp' not found in $PATH
Configured debug adapter: None
Configured formatter: None
Tree-sitter parser: ✓
Highlight queries: ✓
Textobject queries: ✓
Indent queries: ✓
```

As you can see, Helix is reporting that it's configured to use
[ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/),
[ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff)
and [Jedi](https://jedi.readthedocs.io/)
(also pylsp, but we're ignoring that one)
but is saying that none of them are installed. Let's fix that...

```shell-session
$ uv tool install ty
Resolved 1 package in 86ms
Installed 1 package in 4ms
 + ty==0.0.1a22
Installed 1 executable: ty
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 77ms
Installed 1 package in 3ms
 + ruff==0.14.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff
```

<details markdown="1">
<summary>uv tool install?</summary>

[`uv tool install`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install) is uv's equivalent of pipx: it installs each tool into its own isolated virtualenv
(the virtualenvs are located in `~/.local/share/uv/tools/` on my machine,
the `uv tool dir` command will tell you where they are on yours)
and puts symlinks to each tool's executables on your `$PATH`
(the symlinks are in `~/.local/bin/` for me, `uv tool dir --bin` will tell you where they are for you).
`uv tool` will check whether the bin dir is on your `$PATH` and complain if it isn't,
and if that happens you can use `uv tool update-shell` to fix it.
You can use commands like `uv tool list`,
`uv tool upgrade`, and `uv tool uninstall` to manage your installed tools.
</summary>
</details>

Jedi doesn't come with its own builtin language server so we have to install a
third-party one called [jedi-language-server](https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server)
instead (jedi-language-server is [recommended in Jedi's docs](https://jedi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/usage.html#language-servers)):

```shell-session
$ uv tool install jedi-language-server
Resolved 11 packages in 135ms
Installed 11 packages in 30ms
 + attrs==25.4.0
 + cattrs==25.3.0
 + docstring-to-markdown==0.17
 + importlib-metadata==8.7.0
 + jedi==0.19.2
 + jedi-language-server==0.45.1
 + lsprotocol==2023.0.1
 + parso==0.8.5
 + pygls==1.3.1
 + typing-extensions==4.15.0
 + zipp==3.23.0
Installed 1 executable: jedi-language-server
```

`hx --health` will now report that the language servers are installed (again, we're ignoring pylsp):

```shell-session
$ hx --health python
Configured language servers:
  ✓ ty: /Users/seanh/.local/bin/ty
  ✓ ruff: /Users/seanh/.local/bin/ruff
  ✓ jedi: /Users/seanh/.local/bin/jedi-language-server
  ✘ pylsp: 'pylsp' not found in $PATH
```

## Getting it working with your virtualenv

At this point the language servers will just work in Helix.
It's that simple: all you have to do is install the language
servers and they just work.
At least for the standard library.

But the language servers won't know about your project's third-party dependencies:
you'll get `unresolved-import` diagnostics about all your third-party imports,
code completions won't work for third-party libraries,
etc.

To fix this we need to create a virtualenv
in your project's root directory and install
your project's dependencies into it.
In my case my project's dependencies are in an old-school `requirements.txt`
file so I need to create a virtualenv and install that requirements file into it:

```shell-session
$ uv venv  # Creates a virtualenv at .venv
Using CPython 3.11.11
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt  # Installs requirements.txt into .venv
```

For ty and Ruff that's all you need to do: they automatically discover virtualenvs in `.venv` folders.
Just launch `hx` from your project's root directory.

### Teaching Jedi where your virtualenv is

Jedi needs a bit more help: it doesn't know about the location of the virtualenv.
There are several ways to get it working:

1. **Activate the virtualenv**

    One solution is to just activate the virtualenv in your shell before
    launching Helix:

        #!shell-session
        $ source .venv/bin/activate
        $ hx

    That works, but there are other options for people like me who don't like to
    activate virtualenvs...

2. **Use `uv run`**

    Another option is to launch Helix with `uv run`:

        #!shell-session
        $ uv run hx

    `uv run` launches `hx` within the `.venv` virtualenv without having to
    activate the virtualenv in your shell first.

    <small markdown="1">
    It might also be possible to configure Helix to use `uv run
    jedi-language-server` as the command to run jedi-language-server, then you
    could just run `hx` instead of having to do `uv run hx` all the time, but I
    didn't try it.
    </small>

3. **Use a `languages.toml` file**

    If you don't want to use `uv run` either there is a third option: create
    a `.helix/languages.toml` file in the root of your project with these
    contents:

        #!toml
        # .helix/languages.toml

        [language-server.jedi]
        config.workspace.environmentPath = ".venv"

    Now Jedi will know about your virtualenv without needing to activate it:
    just launch `hx` with your project's root directory as the current working
    directory, which you already need to do for ty and Ruff anyway.

    <small markdown="1">
    What's going on here is that jedi-language-server has a
    [`workspace.environmentPath`](https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-serv
    er?tab=readme-ov-file#workspaceenvironmentpath) option for setting the
    virtualenv. This option has to be set via the Language Server Protocol's
    [initializationOptions](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol
    /specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#initialize), and the `config`
    option is how you tell Helix to send initializationOptions to the language
    server, so `config.workspace.environmentPath = ".venv"` tells Helix to
    pass the `workspace.environmentPath = ".venv"` initialization option to
    jedi-language-server.
    </small>

## Limitation: multiple virtualenvs

My project has a `requirements.txt` file that contains all the production requirements
that get installed into the Docker container that actually gets shipped to production.
And it has a `tests.txt` file that contains everything in the `requirements.txt` file
plus additional requirements for running the tests (pytest etc).
`tests.txt` is what gets installed into the virtualenv that the tests run in.

So which requirements file should I install into the `.venv` virtualenv that ty, Ruff and Jedi are using in Helix?

If I install `requirements.txt` into `.venv` then the language servers won't know about my test dependencies.
Whenever I'm editing a test file I'll get diagnostic warnings about every `import pytest`,
autocomplete won't work for pytest stuff,
etc.

But if I install `tests.txt` into `.venv` then the language servers will think that
my test dependencies are fair game in _production_ files.
When editing a source code file I could `import pytest` and nothing would complain,
even though that will absolutely fail (and take down production) if it gets into
the Docker image and deployed.

There's no right answer.
When editing a production source file the language servers need to use a virtualenv
that has only `requirements.txt` installed in it.
When editing a test file they need to use a virtualenv with `tests.txt` installed.

The problem isn't limited to tests: it rears its head in any kind of project-with-multiple-virtualenvs situation,
or when editing multiple projects at once in a single instance of Helix.

As far as I know there's currently no solution to this.
And I'm not sure it's Helix's problem.
It's probably the language servers themselves that need to support
selecting different virtualenvs depending on which particular _file_ is being edited.
A single virtualenv per project or per editor/language server instance isn't enough
to get it completely correct.

## Using Helix's language server support

Alright, we've gone through the trouble of getting it all working.
Now let's take a tour of Helix's LSP-based features...

### Autocomplete

The one that everyone wants and the only language server feature that really matters:
"intelligent" autocomplete suggestions that know about your programming language,
your code, and your dependencies. They look like this in Helix:

<figure markdown="1">
![Autocomplete suggestions in Helix]({static}/images/helix-autocomplete.png "Autocomplete suggestions in Helix")
<figcaption markdown="1">Helix showing autocomplete suggestions.</figcaption>
</figure>

Autocomplete suggestions usually appear automatically as you type,
but if you need to summon the autocomplete menu manually you can do so with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> in insert mode.

There are several pairs of keybindings for moving up and down within the
autocomplete menu:
<kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>,
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd>,
and <kbd>&darr;</kbd> and <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>.

<kbd>Enter</kbd> accepts the current autocomplete suggestion and closes the
autocomplete menu but you don't usually need to do this: just keep typing.

<kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> closes the autocomplete menu
without accepting any completion.

### When language servers collide

In our case autocomplete suggestions are provided by both ty and Jedi (Ruff doesn't provide autocomplete).
This means that you'll get two autocomplete suggestions for the same thing,
one from ty and one from Jedi:

<figure markdown="1">
![Duplicate autocomplete suggestions in Helix]({static}/images/helix-duplicate-completions.png "Duplicate autocomplete suggestions in Helix")
<figcaption markdown="1">
Helix showing two duplicate autocomplete suggestions for `log.warning`:
one from ty and one from Jedi.
Jedi thinks `log.warning` is a function,
ty calls it a method.
They each render the signature and docstring differently too.
</figcaption>
</figure>

ty and Jedi differ in what information they show about each autocomplete suggestion in the popup window to the right,
and they'll also differ in what autocompletions they're capable of suggesting,
so you may want to keep both.

Alternatively you can disable autocompletions from one of the language servers
while still allowing that language server to provide other features.
For example to disable autocompletions from ty
create either a `~/.config/helix/languages.toml` file for global configuration
or a `.helix/languages.toml` file in your project's root directory for per-project configuration,
and add the following contents:

```toml
# languages.toml

[[language]]
name = "python"
language-servers = [
  {name = "ty", except-features = [ "completion" ]},
  "ruff",
  "jedi",
]
```

What's going on here:
Helix has a built-in default `language-servers` setting for each language in its default
[`languages.toml`](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/languages.toml) file.
For Python, `language-servers` [defaults to `["ty", "ruff", "jedi", "pylsp"]`](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/languages.toml#L1044).
What we're doing in the custom `languages.toml` file above is overriding the default
`language-servers` setting for Python with one that replaces `"ty"` with
`{ name = "ty", except-features = [ "completion" ] }`: instead of just a string it's now
an object that both enables the `"ty"` language server and sets `except-features`.

There's also an `only-features` setting that can be used to restrict a language server
to _only_ certain features, rather than disabling certain features individually, for example:
`only-features = [ "format" ]`.

The full list of language server features that can be used in the `except-features`
and `only-features` lists is:
`"format"`,  `"goto-definition"`,  `"goto-declaration"`,  `"goto-type-definition"`,  `"goto-reference"`,  `"goto-implementation"`,  `"signature-help"`,  `"hover"`,  `"document-highlight"`,  `"completion"`,  `"code-action"`,  `"workspace-command"`,  `"document-symbols"`,  `"workspace-symbols"`,  `"diagnostics"`,  `"rename-symbol"`,  `"inlay-hints"`
(see [Configuring Language Servers for a language](https://docs.helix-editor.com/languages.html#configuring-language-servers-for-a-language) in the Helix docs).

### Signature help

When you're typing out a function or method call Helix can show a helpful popup
displaying the signature of the function/method:
the arguments and their types (if known),
an indication of which positional argument you're currently typing,
the return type,
and the beginning of the docstring:

<figure markdown="1">
![Helix's signature help popup]({static}/images/helix-signature-help.png "Helix's signature help popup")
<figcaption markdown="1">Helix showing signature help.</figcaption>
</figure>

The signature help popup will normally appear on its own when needed.
If you do need to summon it manually there's no keybinding for it by default,
but you can open Helix's command palette with <kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>?</kbd>
then search for the `signature_help` command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run it.

<kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> closes the signature help popup.

As with completions both ty and Jedi can generate signature help
but in this case Helix shows only one of them: whichever comes first
in the `language-servers` setting.
The docs say that <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd>
change to the next and previous signatures, but this doesn't seem to work.

I prefer Jedi's signature help over ty's but ty comes first in the default
`language-servers` setting so I disabled signature help from ty in my
`languages.toml`:

```toml
# languages.toml

[[language]]
name = "python"
language-servers = [
  {name = "ty", except-features = [ "completion", "signature-help" ]},
  "ruff",
  "jedi",
]
```

### Diagnostics

Probably the second most popular LSP feature after autocomplete: language
servers can provide diagnostics about your code (hints, warnings, errors, and
other info from tools like linters and type checkers) which Helix can display
in-editor:

<figure markdown="1">
![Helix showing a diagnostic]({static}/images/helix-diagnostics.png "Helix showing a diagnostic")
<figcaption markdown="1">Helix showing some diagnostics.</figcaption>
</figure>

The presence of diagnostics is indicated by coloured circles next to the line numbers in the left-hand-side gutter
and in the status line at the bottom,
and by squiggly underlines under the suspect sections of code.
By default the status line counts only warning and error-level diagnostics,
and only for the current file (not the rest of the workspace).
This is [configurable](https://docs.helix-editor.com/editor.html#editorstatusline-section).
When the cursor is over one of the underlined sections the diagnostic message itself is displayed in the top-right, as can be seen in the screenshot above.

Some keyboard shortcuts for working with diagnostics:

* <kbd>]d</kbd> / <kbd>[d</kbd>: jump to next/previous diagnostic
* <kbd>]D</kbd> / <kbd>[D</kbd>: jump to first/last diagnostic
* There's also a `:yank-diagnostic` command
  (used via Helix's command line that you enter with <kbd>:</kbd>)
  that copies the diagnostic message under the cursor to the system clipboard.

There's optional support for displaying diagnostics inline and at the ends of lines,
it looks like this:

<figure markdown="1">
![Helix showing inline and end-of-line diagnostics]({static}/images/helix-inline-diagnostics.png "Helix showing inline and end-of-line diagnostics")
<figcaption markdown="1">Helix showing inline and end-of-line diagnostics.</figcaption>
</figure>

Inline and end-of-line diagnostics are disabled by default.
To enable them create a Helix config file,
either a `~/.config/helix/config.toml` file for global config
or a `.helix/config.toml` file in your project's root directory for per-project config,
and add this to it:

```toml
# config.toml

[editor]
end-of-line-diagnostics = "hint"

[editor.inline-diagnostics]
cursor-line = "warning"
other-lines = "disable"
```

<small>**Tip:** the command `:config-open` opens your Helix config file from within Helix.
`:config-open-workspace` opens the current project's config file.
After editing the file `:config-reload` reloads the config.</small>

Every diagnostic has a severity level of `hint`, `info`, `warning` or `error`.
You can choose what level a diagnostic must meet in order to be displayed inline or at the end of a line.
In the config above `hint` or higher diagnostics (i.e. all diagnostics) can be displayed at the ends of lines,
`warning` or higher can be displayed inline on the line that the cursor is currently at,
and no diagnostics can be displayed inline on other lines.

There's also a diagnostics picker that gives a birds-eye overview of all diagnostics.
<kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>d</kbd> opens a picker for diagnostics from the current file only,
<kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> opens one for diagnostics from all files in the workspace:

<figure markdown="1">
![Helix's diagnostics picker]({static}/images/helix-diagnostics-picker.png "Helix's diagnostics picker")
<figcaption markdown="1">Helix's diagnostics picker.</figcaption>
</figure>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>"Workspace"?</summary>

Helix has a somewhat implicit and lightly documented concept of "the workspace"
that several features rely on. For example <kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd> opens a
file explorer in the "workspace root" directory. There are many more.

By default the workspace root seems to be the current working directory. But if
one of the CWD's parent directories contains a file or directory like `.git`,
`.svn` or `.helix` then that parent directory will be taken as the workspace
root instead.
</details>

The picker shows the list of diagnostics in the left-hand pane
and a preview of the currently selected diagnostic's line in the right-hand pane.

Helix uses pickers like this for many purposes:
opening files and browsing directories, global search, etc.
Some keybindings for pickers:

* Type to enter a search term and filter the picker contents.
* There are several pairs of keybindings to move the selection up and down:
  <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> and <kbd>&darr;</kbd>,
  <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>,
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd>,
  <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page Down</kbd>,
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>,
  and <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd>.
* <kbd>Enter</kbd> closes the picker and jumps to the selected item.
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> opens the selected item in a horizontal split.
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> opens it in a vertical split.
* <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> opens the selected item without closing
  the picker, allowing you to open multiple files.
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> toggles the right-hand preview pane on and off,
giving more space to the table of items in the left-hand pane.
* Close the picker with <kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.

### Inlay hints

Language servers also support things called "inlay hints" that're similar to
inline diagnostics and are also disabled by default in Helix.
Inlay hints annotate the source code with things like the types of variables
and the names of arguments being passed positionally.
It looks like this (the inlay hints are the words in _italics_, they're not part of the actual file!):

<figure markdown="1">
![Helix's inlay hints]({static}/images/helix-inlay-hints.png "Helix's inlay hints")
<figcaption markdown="1">Helix showing inlay hints.</figcaption>
</figure>

Inlay hints are disabled by default.
You can toggle them on and off with this command:

    :toggle lsp.display-inlay-hints

To enable inlay hints when Helix starts up add this to your config file:

```toml
# config.toml

[editor.lsp]
display-inlay-hints = true
```

### Code actions

<kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>a</kbd> opens a menu of available language server
"code actions" that you can apply: automated code changes that do things
like organise code and fix diagnostic warnings.

For example the Ruff language server provides actions to sort the file's imports,
to auto-fix all auto-fixable Ruff warnings in the file,
and if the cursor is over a Ruff diagnostic there are actions to ignore the diagnostic
by adding a `# noqa` comment or to fix just that diagnostic (if it's auto-fixable by Ruff).

Jedi provides "extract expression into variable" and "extract expression into function"
actions when the cursor is over a suitable expression.

### Code formatting

In our case Python code formatting is provided by the Ruff language server.
To auto-format some Python code select the code and type <kbd>=</kbd>.
To auto-format an entire file type <kbd>%</kbd> to select the whole file
then hit <kbd>=</kbd>, or just run the `:format` or `:fmt` command on Helix's command line.

You can also configure Helix to auto-format files whenever you save them.
Add this to your config file:

```toml
# config.toml

[[language]]
name = "python"
auto-format = true
```

Helix will now auto-format the entire file whenever you save the file
with a command like `:write` / `:w`. Helix also has an auto-save feature
(disabled by default), it will _not_ auto-format files when auto-saving them.

### Navigation: go to definition, references, symbols

Language servers provide various commands for jumping to things:

* <kbd>gd</kbd> jumps to the definition of the symbol under the cursor,
  whether that's in the current file or another file.

* <kbd>gD</kbd> jumps to the _declaration_ of the symbol.
  With Jedi <kbd>gD</kbd> on an imported symbol will jump to the `import`
  in the current file rather than jumping into the other file where the symbol
  is defined.
  With ty <kbd>gD</kbd> seems to do the same as <kbd>gd</kbd>.

* <kbd>gi</kbd> jumps to the _implementation_.
  I'm not sure how that would differ from the definition in Python.
  For me this doesn't seem to work with either ty or Jedi:
  it just says "No definition found".

* <kbd>gr</kbd> opens a picker with a list of all references to the
  symbol under the cursor in all files in the workspace:

    <figure markdown="1">
    ![Helix listing the references to a symbol]({static}/images/helix-list-references.png "Helix listing the references to a symbol")
    <figcaption markdown="1">Helix's picker showing all references to `create_app()`.</figcaption>
    </figure>

* <kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd> opens a similar picker but for _all_ symbols in
  the current file, not just the symbol under the cursor.

* <kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> does the same for symbols across the entire workspace
  but the picker is initially empty: symbols only begin to appear once you start to enter
  a search query.

Again if you have multiple language servers enabled you'll get doubled results from many of these navigation commands:
one from ty and one from Jedi. Helix will show the two results in a menu
and let you choose which one to jump to. If you don't want that
you can disable the various `goto-*` and `*-symbols` features for one of the two
language servers in your `languages.toml`, for example:

```toml
# languages.toml

[[language]]
name = "python"
language-servers = [
  {name = "ty", except-features = ["goto-definition", "goto-declaration", "goto-type-definition", "goto-reference", "goto-implementation", "document-symbols", "workspace-symbols"]},
  "ruff",
  "jedi",
]
```

### Selecting and renaming references

<kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>h</kbd> selects all references to the symbol under the cursor
in the current file.
This uses Helix's multi-cursor/multi-select support so you
have to be familiar with that or it'll be very confusing
(there's a [multiple cursors tutorial](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/2.-Tutorial:-Multiple-Cursors) on the Helix wiki).
It lets you change, delete or otherwise edit all the references at once.

For example in this video I use <kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>h</kbd> to select all references to the `config` argument
under the cursor then type <kbd>c</kbd> <kbd>settings</kbd> <kbd>Esc</kbd>
to rename them all to `settings`:

<video controls>
<source src="{static}/videos/helix-select-references.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

You can do much more with multiple cursors/selections,
but if all you want to do is rename all references to a symbol there's an easier way:
the `rename_symbol` command (keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>r</kbd>)
will ask you for a new name for the symbol under the cursor
and then use the language server to rename all references to it.
  
### Documentation

Finally,
<kbd>Space</kbd> <kbd>k</kbd> shows the docs for the symbol under the cursor
in a popup window:

<figure markdown="1">
![Helix showing a function's docstring]({static}/images/helix-docs.png "Helix showing a function's docstring")
<figcaption markdown="1">Helix showing a function's docstring in a popup window.</figcaption>
</figure>

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd> scroll
the contents of the popup window up and down. You can also use the
scroll-wheel or track-pad.

<kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> closes the popup.

If you have multiple language servers enabled you may get multiple documentation results,
as indicated by the <code><b>[1/2] ty</b></code> in my screenshot indicating that there
are two results available and the one currently displayed is from ty.
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> page through the different results.

As with other LSP features, you can disable documentation popups
from one of the language servers by adding `"hover"` to its
`except-features` setting in `languages.toml`.
